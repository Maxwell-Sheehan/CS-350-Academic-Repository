Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was all about creating a thermostate on an embedded system that used other perhipherials such as LEDS to illustrate the status of the thermostat. The core problem of the project, was using various perhipherial tools with a raspberry pie to make something similar to what an end user would have in their own home. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think in this project I did a really good job hitting deadlines, and meeting the expections of what clients were asking for. Building something physicall on a board takes a lot of time and energy, and really requires you to thoroughly understand the documentation, in a way that most project don't require.

Where could you improve?

I had a lot of issues getting the code to function properly with the LED screen on the GPIO board, this is something that bothered me, because all the test classes worked, and I knew the LED worked, but actually getting it to sync up in my own assignments was always something I spent an hour on. I think to improve I'd just need to fully solve my issue once, then use that working code as a reference in my future endevours.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I absolutly loved the raspberry Pi community, I already know how I'm gonna repourpose my equipement to make a PiHole adblocker on my LAN, and I might even get a second one to make a HA adblocker in my home network. The community is very active, and has a ton of resources and project ideas that I absoltuly will add to my skil set. 


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I think working on physical materials is something I'll add to a lot of future project, I work a lot on embedded systems, and there's really just no teacher  like practical lived experience when it comes to working on an emeded system. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I added comments to my code, my videos narrating the function and use case of the PI clearly elaborate what i'm doing, why, and how the physical interupts are affecting the LED and the back end of the PI. I think this type of thorough note taking enables me to easily revisit the PI for all future projects.
